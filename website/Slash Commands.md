Slash commands are quick ways to perform repetitive tasks. 99% of the time this will mean using a [[^Library/Std/Slash Templates]], but you can also create them more manually using [[Space Lua#Slash commands]].

# Invoking a slash command
You can trigger a slash command by typing a `/` in your text (after some white space) followed by its name (this will auto complete).

Technically, no slash commands ship with SilverBullet directly. However, you can easily add useful ones via [[Libraries]].
