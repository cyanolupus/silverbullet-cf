Commands define actions that SilverBullet can perform. They range from simple edit commands, such as `Text: Bold`, but may be more elaborate such as `Page: Rename`. 

SilverBullet ships with a lot of commands built in, but custom ones can also be defined using [[Space Lua]] and [[Plugs]].

Beside the list below, all commands available commands appear in the [[Command Palette]] but may have key bindings as well (these key bindings appear in the [[Command Palette]] and are configurable in [[^Library/Std/Config]]).

You can create custom command using the [[^Library/Std/Command]] API.
