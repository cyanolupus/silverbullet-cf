According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)):

> **Self-hosting** is the practice of running and maintaining a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) or [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_\(systems_architecture\) "Service (systems architecture)") using a private [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server"), instead of using a service outside of the administrator's own control. Self-hosting allows users to have more control over their data, privacy, and computing infrastructure, as well as potentially saving costs and improving skills.
